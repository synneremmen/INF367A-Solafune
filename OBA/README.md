# Object-Based Augmentation (OBA)

## Overview
**Object-Based Augmentation (OBA)** is a data augmentation technique that generate new training samples by pasting objects onto different backgrounds. The method was presented in the paper ["Object-Based Augmentation Improves Quality of Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05516) (Illarionova et al., 2022). This repository provides flexible functionality for using OBA during model training, with the option to either save generated samples or generate them dynamically during each epoch.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/INF367A-Solafune.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Before running `main.py`, choose dataset = "OBA".

## Usage

Depending on your hardware limitations and training setup, you can choose whether to save generated samples:

* **To save generated samples to disk** (recommended for limited RAM situations):

```python
dataset = create_save_OBA_images(...)
```

* **To generate samples without saving:**
```python
dataset = create_OBA_tensor_dataset(...)
```

In our experiments, following the original Object-Based Augmentation paper, samples were initially generated without saving to minimize memory usage and maintain maximum randomness.
However, we encountered RAM limitations during training â€” generating samples on-the-fly caused the system to crash.
To overcome this, we decided to save the generated images and masks before training. This approach allowed us to train models successfully, even though it slightly reduced randomness between runs.

Even when using saved samples, new samples are generated and saved anew at each training run, ensuring a degree of randomness between runs. 


## OBA Parameters
Both `create_save_OBA_images` and `create_OBA_tensor_dataset` support the following configurable parameters:


| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `prob_of_OBA` | `float` | 0.5 | Probability of generating an OBA sample. |
| `subset` | `bool` | False | Whether to use a subset of the dataset. |
| `augm` | `bool` | True | Apply standard augmentations. |
| `object_augm` | `bool` | True | Apply object-based augmentations. |
| `extra_background_prob` | `float` | 0.0 | Probability of using an additional background. |
| `background_augm_prob` | `float` | 0.6 | Probability of applying background augmentations. |
| `shadows` | `bool` | False | Whether to add shadows to objects. |
| `extra_objects` | `int` | 3 | Number of extra objects to add per sample. |
| `object_augm_prob` | `float` | 0.0 | Probability of augmenting objects. |
| `augm_prob` | `float` | 0.8 | Probability of applying any augmentation. |
| `geometric_augm_prob` | `float` | 0.6 | Probability of applying geometric transformations. |
| `color_augm_prob` | `float` | 0.6 | Probability of applying color augmentations. |
| `batch_size` | `int` | 10 | Batch size for the dataset. |
| `min_area` | `int` | 1000 | Minimum object area (in pixels) to be considered valid. |
| `use_SR` | `bool` | False | Whether to use super-resolution images. |
